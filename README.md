Java
====
This is the very first project I did after I learned Java in the university. Even though my goal at first was to study artificial intelligence, debugging codes seemed to take most of the time. The project is a game called Othello, or Reversi, google the second one will give you the link to wiki. I chose this game as a start simple because of its slightly less complicated rules. But it turned out that it is not simple at all. The AI is still quite weird, so I will keep working on it.

The codes are mostly commented. To run the project, simply run the StartGame.java.

Thanks to Helene for helping me with codes, and thanks to professor Shapiro for helping me with AI. ^^
